            <p>In 2010 I was asked to join a team consisting of three Olympic medal winners, with the goal of being the 2014 Olympic Team.
                Though low on the experience compared to them I quickly found my way and our team had immediate success, winning the 2011 U.S. National Championship.
                We set ourselves up for the chance to be the Olympic team being the first team to qualify for the Olympic Trials.
                In November of 2013 the Olympic Trials began, a five team week long competition to determine the 2014 Olympic Curling Team. We finished the
                round robin in 2nd placed sending us to a best of three series to determine the winner.  We eventually lost the third game and we're eliminated from contention.
                Although severely disapointing our team racked up two national championships, Olympic Trial runner-up, national championship runner up and a number of tournament wins in four years.
                Since then U.S. Curling has taken a different direction, and I was selected to be in its High Performance Program and on its National Team.  2018 will hopefully go the other way this time.</p>

            <p>While living in Bemidji, MN and mostly being a full time curler I became a substitute teacher.  I've always enjoyed learning and
            substitute teaching allowed me to be on the other end of the spectrum.  I subbed for all ages from kindergarten to high school at a variety of
            the area's schools.  Implemented lessons plans as well as came up with on the fly things to do for classes.  Definitely was an interesting
            experience and something I enjoyed having the opportunity to do.</p>
